- [ ] Electronics

## Electronics

- [ ] Configured correctly (dip switches or jumpers)

- [ ] Connections traced to correct destinations

- [ ] RC receiver connected

## Wiring

#### Electrical

- [ ] Fuses of appropriate capacity installed in all fuse holders

- [ ] Resistance check between positive and negative

- [ ] No corroded copper ends

- [ ] Visual inspection/blowout for stray copper strands

- [ ] Disconnected wires must be physically secured and have their ends covered

#### Political

- [ ] Wires colour coded on both sides if necessary

- [ ] All wiring susceptible to mechanical damage (bottom of robot and near mechanisms) covered with armouring

- [ ] Ground bolt is in proper order (see robotics poster pdf)

- [ ] Stack of connections in proper order on fuse box (washers on top)

- [ ] Ground bolt and bolt on fuse box tight

#### Each connection, regardless of voltage:

- [ ] Must be traced to something fused unless permitted otherwise

- [ ] Pull tested

- [ ] Solder joints visually inspected

- [ ] No excess bare wire showing

- [ ] Visual inspection done
